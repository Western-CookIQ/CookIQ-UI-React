This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.

## deployment suggestions

Absolutely, you can use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of your React application to an S3 bucket. GitHub Actions allows you to define workflows directly in your GitHub repository, making it a convenient choice for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tasks.

Here's a simplified example of how you might set up a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying a React application to an S3 bucket:

Step 1: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file in your React project. This file will define the GitHub Actions workflow.

yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy to S3

on:
push:
branches: - main # or the branch you want to trigger deployment on

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 14

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build React Application
        run: npm run build

deploy:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Upload to S3
        uses: jakejarvis/s3-sync-action@master
        with:
          args: --delete --exclude '.git/*' --exclude '.github/*'
        env:
          AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets
In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" > "Secrets" > "New repository secret." Add the following secrets:

AWS_S3_BUCKET: The name of your S3 bucket.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: The AWS access key ID with permissions to upload to the S3 bucket.
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: The corresponding AWS secret access key.
Step 3: Adjust React Build Configuration
Ensure that your React application's build configuration produces artifacts in a format suitable for deployment to S3. This might involve configuring the build output directory and adjusting the paths accordingly.

Step 4: Commit and Push
Commit the changes to your GitHub repository and push them. GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow defined in deploy.yml when changes are pushed to the specified branch (in this example, the main branch).

This GitHub Actions workflow will build your React application and deploy the build artifacts to the specified S3 bucket. You can further customize the workflow to include additional steps, such as invalidating a CloudFront distribution or triggering other deployment-related tasks. Adjust the workflow to fit your specific needs.
